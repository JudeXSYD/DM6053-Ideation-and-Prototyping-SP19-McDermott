Present this research in a 10 minute Powerpoint or video, with citations of at least 10 separate sources throughout. *At least five of the sources must be academic (books, journal articles, museum catalogs)* Cite your sources throughout your presentation and also turn in a bibliography online in NYU Classes. Use [Chicago MLA format.](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/chicago_manual_17th_edition/chicago_manual_of_style_17th_edition.html)

The process presentation will reveal the discoveries you made about your subject, as well as how these discoveries will inform or have informed your own creative processes.

The key to your research is a proliferation of references on your subject, particularly interviews, sketchbooks, notebooks, and/or journals or other reflective writing which can give you insights into the research and design processes of your subject.

### Bibliography

*The Wikipedia Disclaimer: Nowadays, wikipedia is often the starting point for research – it’s quick, easy, and provides an acceptable overview of many subjects. However, for serious, sustained research Wikipedia should not be relied upon as a primary source. Use Wikipedia to familiarize yourself with your subject and to locate other sources for further research.*

Remember that you can use as many non-academic sources as you like, such as interviews in magazines and blogs– but you also need at least 5 academic sources (books, journal articles, museum catalogs). Format your bibliography in [Chicago MLA format.](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/chicago_manual_17th_edition/chicago_manual_of_style_17th_edition.html)
