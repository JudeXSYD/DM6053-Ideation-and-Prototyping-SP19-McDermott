# City as Site: Research and Prototype 

### Part 01: 
Identify an area or aspect of infrastructure or public space in the city to research. 
Develop and implement a unique research strategy to gain information about your site. Document this process.
Examples of research strategies may include:
* Life drawing
* Photo/video documentation
* On-site interviews
* Setting up a physical device or polling machine for gaining input
* Setting up a website for gaining input 
* Creating/distributing fliers, graphic materials, stencils

For more research strategy ideas, refer to Ideo's [Human-centered design guide.](https://www.ideo.com/post/design-kit) 
You may also reference artistic research projects such as Miranda July's [Learning to Love You More](http://learningtoloveyoumore.com/)

### Part 02:
Produce a design for the site which builds on an existing landmark or infrastructure, modifying it, or allowing it to have a double function. 
(For example: stoplights, fire hydrants, statues, parking garages). 
Projects can be political, interventionist, problem-solving, or playful. 

Your project's final form can include renderings, models, photos, videos, a website etc., but **it must include a physical mock-up of some kind.** Document your process well, and be prepared to present it, along with your finished work, in class.
