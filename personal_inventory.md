# Personal Inventory + Love Letter

1. Create a personal inventory of at least 3 objects that you posess that reveal something about you along with audio narration or written commentary, using your smart phone or video camera and post it to your process website by embedding a youtube or vimeo video.

2. Write a love letter or breakup letter to your favorite object (DO NOT USE an object from your personal inventory), product, or service, and post it on your process website.
