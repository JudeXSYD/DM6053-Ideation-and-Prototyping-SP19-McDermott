# Reading Responses 

Reading responses should be short, 200 words, and should include a question or a point you wish to discuss further in class.
Rather than summarizing the text, reading responses should reflect your reaction to or opinion on concepts discussed in the readings. Some of the readings are more dense than others. Try to find an aspect of the reading that resonates with you. For larger chapters, you may skim parts that don't catch your interest, but do a close reading of the portion of the chapter that you wish to discuss further.
