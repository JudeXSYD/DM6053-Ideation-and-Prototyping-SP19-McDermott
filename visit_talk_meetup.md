# Museum or gallery visit, talk, or meetup
 
Before the end of the semester, each student will attend a social gathering or event of your choice (e.g. museum or gallery exhibit, [meetup](http://meetup.com), talk, etc.) to gain ideas and/or conduct research for your Creative Process project OR your City as Site project. 

Write a brief description of the experience on your process website and describe how it relates to your ideas and/or research.
